# ggplot2

The primary purpose of this handbook is to show you how to create clear and informative plots in the R package _ggplot2_. We will look at how _ggplot2_ is structured, how to prepare datasets for use in _ggplot2_ and how to customise plots. We will develop plots in R Markdown documents to aid reproducibility and re-use of plots.
